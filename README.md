IS 410/610 Course Project 
Your assignment is to develop a database design to solve a real-life data management problem. It can be any problem in 
your work environment or for another organization, for example, a bookstore (think of how Amazon uses databases), a 
course management system (think of how UMBC manages courses), a bank (think of how your bank works), and an online 
auction site (think of how Ebay works). You will develop a database to solve this problem. You will use Oracle DBMS 
throughout the project.
